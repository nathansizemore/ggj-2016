## Run Mother Clucker

Every year, the town of Gobblemore sacrifices chickens to appease their creator. It’s a tradition that has been going for many years. The ritual lasts all week; one chicken is chosen per night, and no chicken has ever escaped. Until now. Unfortunately, you’re one of the chickens they have chose to sacrifice this year. It is your job to try and escape the fate that so many of your friends and family have succumbed to for generations. Can you evade the grubby hands of your captors? Or will you be sacrificed in the name of salvation, like so many before you?
